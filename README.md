# Graph Dictionary Learning
This repository is a convenience repo for anyone interested in applying two graph regularized dictionary learning strategies:
1. Dual Graph Regularized Dictionary Learning (DGRDL), a graph regularized dictionary learning method from Yael Yankelevsky and Michael Elad. 10.1109/TSIPN.2016.2605763
2. Graph Regularized Sparse Coding (GSC), a graph regularized dictionary learning method from Miao Zheng, Deng Cai et al. 10.1109/TIP.2010.2090535

The first method was the basis for Webster, an approach for sparsely factorizing fitness matrices. More on that here: https://github.com/joshbiology/gene_fn. 

The source code for those papers was obtained from these websites:
